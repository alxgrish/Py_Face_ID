# Face Recognition System with Updated Embeddings

This project implements a facial recognition system using the face_recognition library. The program allows you to scan faces and recognize them in real time with the ability to update embeddings every 30 seconds. It is also possible to add, delete users and update the list of users in the interface.

## Description

- Face Recognition: The program uses a camera to capture faces and recognize them while preserving the embeddings.
- Embeddings update: User embeddings are updated every 30 seconds to improve recognition accuracy.
- Graphical interface: A simple Tkinter application that allows you to interact with the system (adding, deleting users, starting the recognition process).
- High Performance: Using an optimized image capture process to maintain stable FPS.

## Installation

To run the project, you need to install several
